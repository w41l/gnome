# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

perl-xml-twig: perl-xml-twig (Perl XML transformation module)
perl-xml-twig:
perl-xml-twig: XML::Twig is (yet another!) XML transformation module.
perl-xml-twig: Its strong points: can be used to process huge documents while
perl-xml-twig: still being in tree mode; not bound by DOM or SAX, so it is
perl-xml-twig: very perlish and offers a very comprehensive set of methods;
perl-xml-twig: simple to use; DWIMs as much as possible.
