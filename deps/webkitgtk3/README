WebKitGTK+ is the port of the portable web rendering engine WebKit 
to the GTK+ platform.

This builds the GTK3 and webkit2 interface.  It can be installed 
alongside webkitgtk - the only files that are in both packages 
are /usr/share/gtk-doc/html/webkitgtk/; as long as both webkitgtk
and webkitgtk3 are the same version, the html docs are identical.

geoclue (to enable support for geolocation) is an optional dep.
