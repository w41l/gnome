liboauth is a collection of POSIX-c functions implementing the OAuth Core RFC 5849 standard.
liboauth provides functions to escape and encode parameters according to OAuth specification
and offers high-level functionality to sign requests or verify OAuth signatures as well as perform HTTP requests.

Note: If you want to build with NSS suport instead of OpenSSL pass NSS=yes to the script.
