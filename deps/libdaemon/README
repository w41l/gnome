Libdaemon is a lightweight C library that eases the writing of UNIX
daemons.

It consists of the following parts:

   * A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization
     procedure of a process
   * A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to
     Syslog or STDERR
   * An API for writing PID files
   * An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with
     select() or poll()
   * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected
     to syslog.
