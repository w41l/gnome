# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

eudev: eudev is a fork of systemd-udev with the goal of obtaining better
eudev: compatibility with existing software such as OpenRC and Upstart, older
eudev: kernels, various toolchains and anything else required by users and
eudev: various distributions. In specific it tries to avoid glibc-specific
eudev: functions and gcc-specific constructs by sticking to C99 while
eudev: tracking closely the systemd-udev developments.
