# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

pylint: Pylint is a python tool that checks if a module satisfies a coding
pylint: standard. Pylint is similar to PyChecker but offers more features.
pylint: The big advantage with Pylint is that it is highly configurable,
pylint: customizable, and you can easily write a small plugin to add a
pylint: personal feature.
