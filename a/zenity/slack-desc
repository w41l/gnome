# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

zenity: Zenity (Gtk+ dialog boxes)
zenity: 
zenity: Zenity is a tool that allows you to display  Gtk+ dialog boxes from
zenity: the command line and through  shell  scripts.  It  is  similar   to
zenity: gdialog, but is intended to be saner. It comes from the same family
zenity: as dialog, Xdialog, and cdialog, but it surpasses those projects by
zenity: having a cooler name.
