Budgie is the flagship desktop of the Solus Operating System, and is part of the Solus Project. Designed with the modern user in mind, it focuses on simplicity and elegance. A huge advantage for the Budgie desktop is that it is not a fork of another project, but rather one written from scratch with integration in mind.
