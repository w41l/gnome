opal: opal (Open Phone Abstraction Library)
opal:
opal: OPAL is the Open Phone Abstraction Library, and is the successor to
opal: OpenH323. There were a couple of architectural issues in OpenH323,
opal: especially in the area of the codecs and media channels, that required
opal: a major rewrite. OPAL is designed to be an infrastructure for any
opal: protocol, not just H.323. It enables normalized interfaces so an
opal: application can quickly use a range of "call protocols", be it H.323,
opal: SIP, PSTN hardware, PC sound cards, MGCP or whatever proprietary
opal: protocol might exist. OPAL is under Mozilla Public License (MPL).
